						<p>One of the sun's eight rays of the Philippine flag represents the province for their ancestors' heroic and revolutionary acts in struggling against Spanish colonial rule. Among others, the most noted are Vicar General Gregorio Aglipay of Paniqui, who founded the Philippine Independent Church; and General Francisco Macabulos of La Paz and General Francisco Tañedo of the Tarlac town, both of whom led the Katipunan and liberated areas of the province (and even neighboring Pangasinan and Bulacan) from Spaniards during the war.
							Though in the original document of "The Act of the Proclamation of Philippine Independence," there is no mention of Tarlac being a part of the eight rays, and instead, it was Bataan. Historians believed that because Macabulos had a close tie with Luna, who had bad blood with Aguinaldo, the president deliberately ignored the province because of this feud. Macabulos is also known to have rejected the Pact of Biak na Bato.

Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino Jr, his wife, Corazon "Cory" Aquino, and their son, Benigno "PNoy" Aquino III, were all Tarlaqueños and were descendants of wealthy land-owners and political families of Aquinos and Cojuangcos in the province.

						<p>The date August 21 was signed into law as "Ninoy Aquino Day," a national non-working holiday commemorating the assassination of the journalist-politician in 1983. In the prior years, he served as the Mayor of Concepcion, Provincial Vice-Governor, Provincial Governor, and Philippine Senator. He was recognized by many as the "chief" opposition leader against the then president-turned-dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who would have him incarcerated for more than seven years, then three more years of exile in the United States while he underwent medical treatment. Upon return home, he was gunned down while stepping out of the plane. The profile of the brains for the crime is still disputed to this day, but it sure did set the flames of the people's urge for a new system.

						A snap election occurred in 1986, and the widowed wife Cory was the challenge for the dictator. Marcos, as he controlled most of the political officials, cheated and declared himself the winner. Cory would then ask the public for a nonviolent protest, and on the 25th of February, the People Power revolution succeed, and she assumed office as the first-ever female president of the country.

						Their scion, Benigno "PNoy" Aquino III, will win as the 15th president of the country in 2010, a year shortly after Cory died. He will be known for his economic achievements, and his keen actions to pursue judgment from the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague over China's illegal claims on some of the Western Philippine territorial waters, which was a success.
